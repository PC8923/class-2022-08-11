# class-2022-08-11

Repo for class work on August 11. Try to make the resulting website look like a good final project. Some thoughts:

* Add the code to create the second plot to make_plots.R

* Edit index.Rmd so that it only loads plots. It does no other work, and so is very fast.

* Create another page (by editing the _site.yml) called "Counties"

* Make the second plot to that page. Basic idea is that your home page should only include one plot, along with a few sentences of explanation as to what it means and why it matters. Further plots (and there will always be others) belong on other pages.

* Edit the About page. Include your Github, email contact. Also, provide a link to https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/. Also, include information about your data.

* Edit the home page so that it looks nicer. Get rid of all the default text. Very embarassing to have that included. Write the key paragraph.
